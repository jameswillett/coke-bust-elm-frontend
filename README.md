# coke-bust-elm-frontend
elm frontend for coke bust website 2.0

(needs https://github.com/jameswillett/coke-bust-api running)

`elm-app start` to run the dev server  

`elm-app build` to get production build

to serve make sure you have `serve` installed (`npm install -g serve`)  

`ELM_APP_API_URL=http://wherevertheapilives.com serve -s -p 3000 build` to serve the production build (port 3000 is obviously the best port)
